## 📜 My Development Standards
I maintain a personal **Developer SOP** ensuring:
- **Complete Documentation** — README, API specs, architecture diagrams, database schemas.  
- **Structured Git Workflow** — `feature/`, `bugfix/`, `docs/`, `release/` with Conventional Commits.  
- **Code Quality** — Style guides (Go fmt, ESLint, Prettier) and tested core logic.  
- **Deployment Discipline** — `.env` handling, CI/CD pipelines, rollback plans.  
- **Ongoing Maintenance** — Dependency updates, security audits, refreshed docs.
