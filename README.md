## ✍️ What I'm Writing
I’m currently writing a series on **Full-Stack Interview Prep**, where I explain common interview topics simply, with examples in Go and Node.js.  

- [#1: SQL Injection Explained Simply](https://dev.to/davjesse/full-stack-interview-prep-1-sql-injection-explained-simply-with-go-nodejs-examples-lg6)
- [#2: XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) Explained Simply](https://dev.to/davjesse/full-stack-interview-prep-2-xss-cross-site-scripting-explained-simply-with-go-nodejs-8ee)

## 📜 My Development Standards
I maintain a personal **Developer SOP** ensuring:
- **Complete Documentation** — README, API specs, architecture diagrams, database schemas.  
- **Structured Git Workflow** — `feature/`, `bugfix/`, `docs/`, `release/` with Conventional Commits.  
- **Code Quality** — Style guides (Go fmt, ESLint, Prettier) and tested core logic.  
- **Deployment Discipline** — `.env` handling, CI/CD pipelines, rollback plans.  
- **Ongoing Maintenance** — Dependency updates, security audits, refreshed docs.
