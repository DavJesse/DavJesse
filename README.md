# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm David Jesse Odhiambo  
## Full-Stack Developer | Go | JavaScript/Node.js | React | TypeScript

I build solutions that are **scalable, user-focused, and maintainable**.  
I work across the stack â€” from designing clean backend APIs in Go and Node.js to crafting intuitive frontends in React and TypeScript.

## My Development Standards
I follow a personal **Developer SOP** to ensure all projects remain clean, maintainable, and easy to onboard.  
Key principles include:
- **Clear Documentation** â€” Every repo includes a complete `README.md`, API specs, architecture diagrams, and database schemas where applicable.
- **Structured Branching** â€” Clear Git workflow (`feature/`, `bugfix/`, `docs/`, `release/`) with Conventional Commits for traceability.
- **Code Quality** â€” Language-specific style guides (Go fmt, ESLint, Prettier) and tests for core logic.
- **Deployment Discipline** â€” `.env` management, CI/CD pipelines, documented rollback plans.
- **Ongoing Maintenance** â€” Regular dependency updates, security audits, and documentation refreshes.
