# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm David Jesse Odhiambo
## Full-Stack Developer | Go | JavaScript/Node.js | React | TypeScript

Iâ€™m a full-stack developer passionate about building solutions that are scalable, user-focused, and maintainable.
I enjoy working across the stack â€” from designing clean backend APIs in Go and Node.js to crafting intuitive frontends in React and TypeScript.

## What Iâ€™m working on
- **Stock Portfolio Tracker** â€” A Next.js + TypeScript app that lets users track and visualize their stock investments using real-time data from the Finnhub API. Features include portfolio performance charts, stock search, and persistent storage with SQLite.  
- Enhancing my backend skills with Go and Node.js API projects.  
- Exploring Python for automation scripts and data processing.

## My Development Standards
I follow a personal **Developer SOP** to ensure all my projects are clean, maintainable, and easy to onboard.  
Key principles include:
- **Clear Documentation** â€” Every repo includes a complete `README.md`, API specs, architecture diagrams, and database schemas where applicable.
- **Structured Branching** â€” I use a clear Git workflow (`feature/`, `bugfix/`, `docs/`, `release/`) with Conventional Commits for traceability.
- **Code Quality** â€” I follow language-specific style guides (Go fmt, ESLint, Prettier) and maintain tests for core logic.
- **Deployment Discipline** â€” `.env` management, CI/CD pipelines, documented rollback plans.
- **Ongoing Maintenance** â€” Regular dependency updates, security audits, and documentation refreshes.
